## Components

### `revenue_visualizations.py`

Single script that generates both visualizations as interactive HTML files.

### 1. Revenue vs. Foot Traffic Correlation (Animated Scatter Plot)

Interactive bubble chart showing the relationship between check-ins and revenue for each venue.

- **X-axis**: Number of check-ins (foot traffic)
- **Y-axis**: Total revenue
- **Bubble size**: Average spending per visit
- **Color**: Venue type (Pub vs. Restaurant)
- **Animation**: Timeline bar + play button to scrub through weeks

### 2. Weekly Trends by Venue Type (Dual Y-Axis Line Chart)

Tracks revenue and foot traffic over time on synchronized axes.

- **Left Y-axis**: Total spending (revenue)
- **Right Y-axis**: Total check-ins (foot traffic)
- **X-axis**: Week
- **Line color**: Differentiates venue type and metric
