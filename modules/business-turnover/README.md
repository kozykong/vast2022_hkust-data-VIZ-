## Components

### `app.py` — Combined Layoff Dashboard (Dash)

Interactive dashboard with tabbed views (Map View / Treemap View) and summary statistics cards.

**Summary stats**: Companies with layoffs, total workers, total laid off, overall layoff percentage.

### `layoff_timeline.py` — Monthly Working Population (Plotly)

Tracks total employed participants month-over-month across the study period.

- Area chart with markers for significant changes (e.g., 13% drop)
- Dashed trend line projection
- Bar chart overlay on secondary Y-axis for monthly change magnitude
- Quarter annotations (Q1, Q2, Q3)

### `layoff_map.py` — Geographical Layoff Distribution (Plotly)

Spatial view of layoffs by employer location (March → April 2022).

- Building footprints rendered from WKT polygon data (Shapely)
- Employer markers with color intensity and size encoding layoff count
- Red color scale for layoff magnitude

### `layoff_treemap.py` — Layoffs by Employer Size (Plotly)

Hierarchical treemap of layoff distribution across company size categories.

- Hierarchy: All Companies → Size Category (Small / Medium / Large) → Individual Employers
- Rectangle area proportional to layoff count
- Blues color scale encoding company size

## Key Findings

- The workforce experienced a significant 13% decline, primarily concentrated in a single month
